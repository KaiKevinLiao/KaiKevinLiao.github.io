  title={Market Congestion and Efficiency of Decentralized Markets: Evidence from Salvage Car Auctions},
  author={Liao, Kai},
  journal={},
  year={2025},
  abstract={In decentralized online marketplaces, platforms often employ non-price mechanisms to reduce market congestion, 
  enhance revenue, and improve efficiency. This study explores how the choice of trading mechanisms affects the dynamics 
  of supply and demand. We develop a dynamic auction model incorporating endogenous entry, product heterogeneity, and 
  bargaining to analyze the U.S. salvage car market. We characterize a static equilibrium where the demand and supply are 
  shaped both by arriving agents and the existing agents. Using a novel dataset obtained through web scraping, we estimate the 
  demand system of incoming buyers and investigate how their entry and bidding decisions shape the product space at equilibrium. 
  In the counterfactual study, our findings suggest that transitioning from the current mixed selling method—consisting of Pure 
  Sale (a no-reserve auction) and Reserve Sale (a reserve auction followed by contingent negotiation)—to exclusively Pure Sale 
  reduces the demand-side market thickness by 53\% and supply-side market thickness by 23\%, resulting in a drop in the aggregate 
  buyer-to-seller ratio from 3.39 to 2.24. Despite these reductions, the change would increase overall welfare by 5\% due to less 
  congestion and information friction.},

    abstract = {This article investigates the impact of spectrum concentration on the quality of wireless services. The article develops a theoretical model of wireless service competition, examining how spectrum endowments affect the quality of service offered to consumers, particularly download speeds. The findings suggest that while spectrum concentration can enhance efficiency, it also reduces service providers’ incentives to compete. The article employs an empirical model to assess the relationship between spectrum concentration and service quality. These insights inform the ongoing policy debate on the optimal level of spectrum concentration to balance service quality and market competition.},
